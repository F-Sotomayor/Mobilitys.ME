# Mobilitys.ME Project  

This was the first website that i've ever developed for someone, this didnt end up being used since the people that was behind the idea ghosted. I've done this with very basic tools since i had only 2 months into coding when i got the chance to work on this.

Installation:

git clone https://github.com/F-Sotomayor/Mobilitys.ME.git
npm install
npm start

Live Demo: https://mobilitys-me.vercel.app/
